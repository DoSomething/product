# Let's Do This

A DoSomething.org native app.

## Campaigns

Campaigns to be included in the app are found by querying the Campaigns endpoint where `mobile_app=true`.

### Main Feed

Campaigns displayed in the Main Feed should be sorted alphabetically.

### Reportbacks

Reportback Items which have been `promoted` should be displayed first, then `approved`.

## User Profile (Hub)

On all screens, if a user avatar/name is tapped, the user's profile is displayed.

### Reportbacks

All of a User's non-`flagged` Reportback Items of current Campaigns are displayed.
